Disclaimer.</h2> <p class=bg-danger> I won't take any responsability for non-working builds or anything that might happen during and after your build. This includes, but <u>is not limited to</u>, electric shocks, fire, malfunctions, accidents (involving tools or not). <br> All informations provided on this web site are provided 'as is' and appear on the site without express or implied warranties of any kind.</p> </p> <h2>2. Introduction.</h2> <p> Building large DIY electronic project can be very hard ...<br> With over 187 references and more than 800 components, I had to find a way to help you in successfully building your very own MME. </p> <p> When building prototypes with home made boards, I was always using Eagle 'show' command to locate components on the different circuit boards. When I received the first manufactured boards, I realized that searching for evey components listed in the BOM was too time consuming. <br>I needed something that help me out in this task ... hence this web application. </p> <p>While I tried to pay attention to every details, there might be some mistakes here and there. <br>Use the <kbd>'Report an issue'</kbd> button to notify me about errors.If you have some feature ideas, I'll be glad to add them too.</u>. </p> <h2>3. Shopping done right.</h2> <h3>3.1 Selecting the right part.</h3> <p>If you look at the different boms you will notice that each row contains a highlighted cell : <u>this is the part that have been used to build prototypes</u>. <br>Of course, you are free to use whatever part from whatever shop suits you, but I recommend using the one I used. <br><strong>All other references are here for convenience. I did not test them myself.</strong> </p> <h3>3.2 Buy more than needed.</h3> <p>The MME uses a lot of transistor matched pairs so you'll have to buy more transistsors that you actually need. If possible try to not buy them 'in bulk'. Prefer parts that are packaged as 'cut tape' or 'reel' : you will have more chance to find identical pairs. <br>This is also true for matched resistors. </p> <h2>4. Soldering.</h2> <p>The soldering guides walk you thru soldering each part that have the same value and package on each side of the boards. Steps order mainly depends on the part height : if you bought the 'recommended parts' you will just have to follow the steps. However, if you choose differrent ones, the step order might be different. <u>(For now, you don't have the possibility to re-order steps)</u>. </p> <p> Pay attention to the 'note' for each step. It contains relevant informations that will help you soldering a component : <strong>This is particularly important for switches and potentiometers.</strong> </p> <h2>5. Powering.</h2> <p>Your MME supports the eurorack +12V/-12V powering standard thru the usual 5 pins headers (-12V/GND/GND/GND/+12V). <br> The red stripe (-12V) of your powering cable should be on the same side as indicated on the Analog Board PSU connector.<br> <em>If you are looking for a good value PSU try the MeanWell XXXXX. I have been powering all my prototypes with great results.</em> </p> <p>While it is possible to power your MME from a +15/-15V power supply <u>I do not recommend it</u> : onboard regulators do not have heatsinks so they might get hot pretty quickly.</p> </div> <div class=col-md-1></div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
